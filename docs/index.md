# Agricoop

 is a group that aims to ensure Rwandan farmers who deal with the  plantation of beans get paid on time by the cooperatives. Our solution is to create a web platform which will help cooperatives keep records and make payments since after conducting our research we realised that payments get delayed due to lack of digitized systems that help them process details in a faster way.
